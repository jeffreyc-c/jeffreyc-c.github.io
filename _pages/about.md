Welcome! I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://polisci.rutgers.edu/). I am also a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) (2021-2026) and a Graduate Assistant with the [Borders & Boundaries Project](https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse/borders-and-boundaries-project) hosted at Perry World House, University of Pennsylvania and Rutgers University. 

My research examines the intersection of borders, human security, and state-making in international politics. My dissertation focuses on the local communities who uniquely borders, introducing original concepts and evidence to explain how they are navigating the global trend toward walls and other forms of border hardening. In a side project, my co-authors and I examine the gendered dimensions of public demands for border control. 

Prior to my graduate studies, I received a B.A. in Political Science, History, and Arabic from Florida Atlantic University.
