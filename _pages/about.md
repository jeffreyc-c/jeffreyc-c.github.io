Welcome! I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://polisci.rutgers.edu/). I am also a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) (2021-2026) and a Graduate Assistant with the [Borders & Boundaries Project](https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse/borders-and-boundaries-project) hosted at Perry World House, University of Pennsylvania.

My research agenda examines the nexus of human security and state-society relations in international border politics. My dissertation focuses on the local communities who are uniquely exposed to borders, introducing original concepts and data to explain how they are navigating the trend toward walls and other forms of hardening. In a side project, my co-authors and I examine the gendered dimensions of public demands for border control. 

Prior to my graduate studies, I received a B.A. in Political Science, History, and Arabic from Florida Atlantic University.
