Welcome! I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://polisci.rutgers.edu/). I am also a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) (2021-2026) and a Graduate Assistant with the [Borders & Boundaries Project](https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse/borders-and-boundaries-project) hosted at Perry World House, University of Pennsylvania.

My research agenda broadly concerns international border politics. My dissertation draws attention to the local communities who are uniquely exposed to border hardening policies. The project introduces original concepts and data to explain the interrelated topics of when these populations resist hardening, how it affects their identities, and, conversely, how they impact policy. In a side project, my co-authors and I examine the gendered dimensions of public demands for border control. 

Prior to my graduate studies, I received a B.A. in Political Science, History, and Arabic from Florida Atlantic University.
