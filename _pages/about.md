Welcome! I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://polisci.rutgers.edu/). My research examines the local politics of international borders. In my dissertation, I develop and test an original theory about transnational ties in border areas to explain when local communities resist border control and how states respond to these demands. In a side project, my co-authors and I examine the gendered dimensions of public demands for border control. 

I am a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) (2021-2026) and a Graduate Assistant with the [Borders & Boundaries Project](https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse/borders-and-boundaries-project) hosted at Perry World House, University of Pennsylvania.

Prior to my graduate studies, I graduated with a B.A. in Political Science, History, and Arabic from Florida Atlantic University.
