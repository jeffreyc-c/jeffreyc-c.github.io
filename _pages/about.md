Welcome! I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://polisci.rutgers.edu/). I am also a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) (2021-2026) and a Graduate Assistant with the [Borders & Boundaries Project](https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse/borders-and-boundaries-project) hosted at Perry World House, University of Pennsylvania.

My research examines the nexus of human security and state-society relations in international border politics. In my book-length dissertation project, supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, I take up the challenge of theorizing borderlands as unique geopolitical spaces and local communities as central actors. My multi-method approach encompasses global quantitative analyses with an original geospatial measure of local ties across borders, qualitative fieldwork at the United States (U.S.)â€“Mexico border, and both observational and experimental survey tests. In a side project, my co-authors and I examine the gendered dimensions of public demands for border control. 

Prior to my graduate studies, I received a B.A. in Political Science, History, and Arabic from Florida Atlantic University.
