Welcome! I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://polisci.rutgers.edu/). I am also a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) (2021-2026) and a Graduate Assistant with the [Borders & Boundaries Project](https://global.upenn.edu/perryworldhouse/borders-and-boundaries-project) hosted at Perry World House, University of Pennsylvania.

My research examines the local politics of international borders. In my dissertation, I develop and test an original theory about transnational ties in border areas to explain when local communities resist border control efforts by states. In a side project, my co-authors and I examine the gendered dimensions of public demands for border control. 

My research examines the nexus of human security and state-society relations in international border politics. In my book-length dissertation project, supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, I take up the challenge of theorizing borderlands as unique geopolitical spaces and local communities as central actors. My theory explains local resistance against hardening, how hardening drives social differentiation, and the influence of bottom-up demands on hardening. My multi-method approach encompasses global quantitative analyses with an original geospatial measure of local ties across borders, qualitative fieldwork at the United States (U.S.)â€“Mexico border, and both observational and experimental survey tests. Overall, the project shows that the proliferation of hardening should be understood as a point of tension not only with the liberal international order but with peripheral populations in domestic politics.

Prior to my graduate studies, I received a B.A. in Political Science, History, and Arabic from Florida Atlantic University.
