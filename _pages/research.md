In my book-length dissertation project, supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, I take up the challenge of theorizing borderlands as unique geopolitical spaces and local communities as central actors. Knowledge about the macro-level causes and effects of border hardening is abundant, but little is understood about its “on-the-ground” politics. Compared to country interiors, local communities have the unique opportunity to engage with people, goods, cultures, and institutions across the border. Local communities also directly observe and experience changes in how borders are governed. 

Given this distinct position, how are such communities navigating the global trend toward hardened borders? I answer this question on three axes: (1) the conditions under which local communities oppose border hardening, (2) how border hardening affects relations between local communities and states, and (3) how communities conversely impact the form that border policy takes. The empirical basis of the project is a multi-method approach comprising global quantitative analyses with an original geospatial measure of transnational ties, qualitative fieldwork at the United States–Mexico border, and both observational and experimental survey tests.
